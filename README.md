# Bigram Language Model with PyTorch

This repository implements a Bigram Language Model using PyTorch. The model is designed to process text data, tokenize it, and generate sequences based on learned patterns. Below is an overview of the key components and functionalities of the model.

## Features

- **Text Processing**: Reads input text from a file and performs simple tokenization.
- **Model Architecture**:
  - Implements a transformer-like architecture with multi-head self-attention.
  - Utilizes embedding layers for tokens and positional information.
  - Comprises multiple transformer blocks for processing input sequences.
- **Training and Evaluation**:
  - Supports training on a specified dataset with a train-validation split.
  - Includes functionality for estimating loss on training and validation datasets.
- **Text Generation**: Capable of generating new text sequences based on the trained model.

## Installation

Make sure to have PyTorch installed. You can install it via pip:
